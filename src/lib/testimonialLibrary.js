    description: `The clock says 12, the time has passed,
Our days with you have flown too fast.
Lessons taught with patient grace,
Now linger in this empty space.

We laughed, we learned, we made mistakes,
Yet you stood firm through all our aches.
But now we go, and in our chest,
Regret and gratitude both rest.

For every word we left unsaid,
For all the wisdom you had spread,
A simple “thank you” won’t suffice,
Yet it's all we have—our sacrifice.

So as we part and walk away,
Know in our hearts you’ll always stay.

Thank you everyone, 
MONITOR,

Thank u sir for all the time that you have given to these young kinds .. We as a guardian wanted the class to end but you even at midnight would not rest your busy hands and minds continue the class . Being myself a Teacher I must say , we have things to learn and miles to go before we become even as good as you in what you do .. I must come back with my younger boys two years down the line, until then I must say you have inspired not only the students but the guardians as well .. 

Take care Sir ..

    description: `Thank you again for your indelible knowledge 
I wish I would have attended offline classes to witness you teaching physically and grasp concepts to the depths. 
Nevertheless - I had heard of a Chemistry teacher in our school Mr. K N Pradhan while I was doing my research on teachers of St. Augustine’s School Kalimpong- who used to be just like you in teaching. I believe I was able to witness the greatness of teaching chemistry.

    description: `I wanted to take a moment to sincerely thank you for all the support, guidance, and patience you have shown me throughout my chemistry journey. I still remember how I started, struggling to understand even the simplest concepts. But with your dedication and encouragement, everything began to make sense. <br/>

Your clear explanations, engaging lessons, and constant motivation have truly transformed my understanding of chemistry. I never imagined I would confidently say that i enjoy chemistry as one of my favourite subjects.Today, my paper went quite well and Im expecting around the 70/80 mark… <br/>

This achievement of mine wouldnt have been possible with your willigness to go the extra mile to ensure we understood the concept properly. <br/>

Thank you once again for making such a positive impact on my learning journey. I will forever be grateful to you and your efforts. <br/>
